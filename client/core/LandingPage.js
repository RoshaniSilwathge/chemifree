       <br></br>
    
We are Saarabhoomi Agro, a Sri Lankan enterprise striving to further the concept of ecological farming. In order to achieve this mission, we have researched and manufactured a fertilizer and a pest repellent, by only using local and natural resources.
We guarantee the quality of our products and do not use any external chemicals. We follow an agile process with continuous improvement of our products based on feedback from farmers. We also conduct laboratory testing with relevant accredited institutions.
After years of dedicated work, we have been able to successfully introduce a Liquid Fertilizer (Crop Star), Natural Herbal Pest Repellent (Bio Guard) and a Compost with high Microbial Density for our farmers. We have done many field tests with the help of experienced farmers and our concept is to use a combination of our products for the mutual benefit of each otherâ€™s maximum effectiveness.
Our Microbial Compost (Super Bio Treat) needs to be applied during the soil preparation time and it will re-treat the soil biologically and enrich it with nutrients. The Liquid Fertilizer can be added afterwards to energize the crops and soil condition by fostering the micro-organisms. Pests and diseases will be controlled naturally using this combination, however if further measures are required, our Natural Herbal Pest Repellent can be applied.
We are a registered fertilizer manufacturer in Agricultural Ministry and the Fertilizer Secretariat in Sri Lanka.
